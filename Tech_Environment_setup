Permission Errors:

Run the terminal or Git Bash as administrator if you encounter permission issues.
VirtualBox
VirtualBox is a free, open-source software that allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single computer by creating virtual machines. It acts like a simulated computer within your actual computer, letting you install and use systems like Linux, Windows, or macOS without affecting your main setup. This is especially useful for testing software, learning new operating systems, or running apps that only work on a specific platform. Each virtual machine operates independently, with its own virtual hardware, and you can easily switch between them or delete them without risk to your main system.

Windows installation
Download VirtualBox: Go to the Oracle VirtualBox website (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
Virtual Box installation

Select the Windows host version.

Run installer: Locate the downloaded .exe file, double-click to run the installer.

Wizard: Click "Next" through the installation wizard. Click next to all the remaining prompts, leaving every option at default.

Install VirtualBox: Lastly, click Install to complete the installation. When installation is complete, click FINISH to complete the installation.

Launching VirtualBox: Open from the Start Menu, use the desktop shortcut, or simply type "VirtualBox" in the Windows app search.

Network Issues in Virtual Machines:

Check that the VirtualBox network adapter is enabled in the VM settings.
Restart the virtual machine and your host computer if needed.
USB Devices Not Detected:

Install the VirtualBox Extension Pack from the official website.
Make sure your user account has permission to access USB devices.
If you continue to experience problems, consult the VirtualBox User Manual or visit the VirtualBox forums.

Ubuntu (Linux Distro) on VirtualBox (Windows Host)
Download Ubuntu Desktop ISO file: Go to the Ubuntu official website. Ubuntu

VirtualBox: Launch your already installed VirtualBox application on your computer. This is the program that will allow you to create and manage virtual machines.

Create a New Virtual Machine: To create a new VM, click on the "NEW" button or the plus symbol at the top center of the VirtualBox window. This will start the process of setting up a new virtual machine for Ubuntu.

Configure the virtual machine: Choose Linux as the type and Ubuntu as the version. Allocate at least 2GB of RAM for the virtual machine. Create a virtual hard disk, choosing either dynamic or fixed size—dynamic recommended.

Select an installation file: Choose the Ubuntu .iso file that you downloaded from the Ubuntu website.

Start the Virtual Machine: Launch the virtual machine and start the Ubuntu installation process.

Install Ubuntu: When the Ubuntu installer appears, select your language and click "Install Ubuntu." Follow the on-screen instructions to choose your keyboard layout, select "Normal installation," and check "Download updates while installing Ubuntu." Choose "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" (this only affects the virtual disk), and enter your name, computer name, username, and password when prompted.

Complete Installation: Once the installation is complete, you’ll be prompted to restart the virtual machine. Click "Restart Now." If prompted, remove the installation medium (the ISO) by clicking "Devices" > "Optical Drives" > uncheck the Ubuntu ISO. Press "Enter" to reboot. After rebooting, log in with the username and password you created. You now have a fully functional Ubuntu system running in VirtualBox.
